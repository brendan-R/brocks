  lib_dir = "htmlwidgets_deps", includes_dir = "_includes/htmlwidgets/",
  always = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{The file path for the input file being knit}

\item{knit_meta}{The dependencies object.}

\item{lib_dir}{The directory where the htmlwidgets dependency source code can
be found (e.g. JavaScript and CSS files)}

\item{always}{Should dependency files always be produced, even if htmlwidgets

\description{
Unlike static image plots, the outputs of htmlwidgets dependencies also have
Javascript and CSS dependencies, which are not by default processed by knitr.
\code{htmlwdigets_deps} provides a system to add the dependencies to a Jekyll
blog. Further details are available in the following blog post:
